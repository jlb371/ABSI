       <h2 id="about-title">About ABSI</h2>
       <p id="about-text">During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, many business shut their doors for good. Some, however, did open. One of these small businesses
           was <i>Mystic Mixtures Potion Bar</i>. It was run out of a small kitchen in Pittsburgh, PA and had only one employee who was also the owner of this new business.
           The creator of ABSI watched as her significant other learned the ins and out of running a business and the difficulties that come with it. The couple had to spend time
           learning about how to take professional photos, how a business's social media should run, finding markets to sell at, and the list goes on. <br><br> ABSI was created to help 
           those in a similar situation. Starting a business should be fun. ABSI works to keep it that way.
       </p>

           <h3 id="about-subtitle">Calendar</h3>
           <p id="about-text">ABSI's calendar keeps you on track. Enter an event such as <i>'farmer's market'</i> and include a checklist to your reminder so you're ready when the day
            comes. Want to remember when to start up a sale? Just set a reminder. You can use the tag <i>'Sale Events'</i> so you can see all of your planned sale events all at once.
            Do you frequently forget to order more items to create your product? There are several ways you can set up reminders. If you consistently need the same amount of something
            each month, you can just set up a monthly reminder using the tag <i>'Refresh Stocks'</i>. You could also set up a link between your ABSI account and your account sale's accounts.
            Set up a minimum stock alert so as you sell items you do not have to worry about keeping track of when you need to get more!</p>
